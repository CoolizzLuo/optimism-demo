# Optimistic Update Example with React Query

This project demonstrates optimistic updates using React Query in a React application. The example showcases how the UI can be updated instantly on user interactions, providing a better user experience, while handling server response success or failure gracefully. The main files in this project are `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `ReactQueryLikeCounter.tsx`, and `api/mock.ts`, which are organized to simulate the optimistic update behavior using a mock API for liking an item.
